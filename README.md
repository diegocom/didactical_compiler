# Didactical Compiler

The project "Didactical Interpreter" was extended by implementing a compiler that try to obfuscate the simple taint analisys control, that with the compiled code should will fail.
So, it's necessary to implement a compiler that transforms an input "giaco" program into an output program semantically equals to the previous one but with the addition of appropriate blurring structures, as indirect assignements.
